# Honest Calculator â€“ Stage 2: First calculations

---

## ðŸ§  Description

In this stage, we will continue with the flowchart. Note that the blocks from the previous stage are in red. Be careful; some flows can work differently.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Implement the flowchart above. While doing it, please, follow our recommendations:

- Don't use the built-in functions to calculate from a string;
- The `result` variable must be of the `float` type;
- Copy the message. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. So don't add extra lines or characters: `msg_3 = "Yeah... division by zero. Smart move..."`

## ðŸ“Œ Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`>`) represents the user input.

Example 1:

```text
Enter an equation
> 2 + m
Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
> 3 n 3
Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?
Enter an equation
> 4 / 0
Yeah... division by zero. Smart move...
Enter an equation
> 4 * 5.2
20.8
```
Example 2:

```text
Enter an equation
> 411 - 211
200.0
```
